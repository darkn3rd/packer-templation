# **Packer Templation**

*Tempting templates for Packer* are some results of experiments using Pakcer to build system images for [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), and cloud solutions like [AWS AMI](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html) and [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/) using [Packer](packer.io) build tool.
